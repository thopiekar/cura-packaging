Description: Slicing application for 3-D printers (GUI)
 Cura converts digital 3D models into printing instructions (G-code)
 for your 3D printer. It cuts the model into horizontal slices (layers),
 generates toolpaths to fill them and calculates the amount of material
 to be extruded.
 .
 Cura is easy to use for novices and provide over 200 settings to adjust
 for the expert.  It can output G-Code for several series of 3D printers,
 most notably the Ultimaker.
 .
 This package provides the user interface.

Description:  3D printer / slicing GUI built on top of the Uranium framework
 This is the new, shiny frontend for Cura. daid/Cura is the old legacy Cura that everyone knows and loves/hates.
 .
 We re-worked the whole GUI code at Ultimaker, because the old code started to become a unmaintainable.

Description:  Cura plugin - SliceInfo
 This is plugin is used to collect statistics of the user's usage of Cura. You can enable/disable collecting data in Cura, too.
 .
 NOTE: I personally recommend to install and enable this plugin. Ultimaker sets priorities by their collected stats. So if there are to less people using Cura with Linux, they simply won't work on Linux-specific issues (at least so quickly). So better keep it enabled, so Linux support will be kept alive!
